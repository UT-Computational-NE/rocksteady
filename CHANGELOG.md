# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

### Breaking changes

- `Test` is renamed `Outcome`, and `CriterionResult.test` is renamed
  `CriterionResult.outcome`. The old name made pytest try to collect the
  enum as a test class in any test module that imported it.
- `Detector.update` raises `ValueError` if `t` does not increase.
- A step in `t` of more than 1.5 sample periods is now treated as a gap.
  With the default `Timing.max_gap_s = 0` it resets the detector, as a
  non-finite sample already did. Previously timestamps were ignored.

### Label changes

- At the start of a record (no disturbance since `reset`), the settling
  wait `settle_s` after the window first fills is labelled
  `indeterminate` instead of `settling`, because nothing was disturbed.
  The wait itself is unchanged. Golden snapshot `drift`: samples 299-358.

### Added

- `rocksteady.signals`: `mean`, `spread`, `difference` source builders.
- `FloorLatch` override (generalized from the reactor zero-power rule).
- `Timing.max_gap_s` and `Timing.min_block_coverage`: tolerate short runs
  of missing data, using NaN-aware block means.
- `Timing.undecided_counts_toward_hold` (default True, the previous
  behaviour).
- `Criterion.min_blocks`; the detector rejects windows too short for its
  criteria.
- `batch.run` uses a `DatetimeIndex` for sample times when `t` is not given.

### Fixed

- `CriterionResult.ratio` is infinite when the statistic or uncertainty is
  not finite, so `Verdict.eta` and `Verdict.limiting` no longer depend on
  the order of the criteria.
